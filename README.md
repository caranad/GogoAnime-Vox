# GogoAnime Vox (Anime Episode Voice Search)

Using the power of the Speech Recognition API, and npm library for scraping anime episodes from GogoAnime, I created a front-end application using React to easily obtain links to watch anime episodes with minimal clicking.

# Voice Commands Available
**GET** [optional: **JAPANESE**] [anime name] **EPISODE** [episode number]: displays the video corresponding to the [episode number]th episode of anime series with the title [anime name]. To only include Japanese subbed versions in your results, add the optional **JAPANESE** flag in your command.

**NOTE**: If multiple anime series are displayed, must pick a number to narrow down search result

# Examples

**GET** Sword Art Online **EPISODE** 3 => Get episode 3 of anime series titled Sword Art Online

**GET** **JAPANESE** Digimon Adventure **EPISODE** 10 => Get episode 10 of all subbed anime series titled Digimon Adventure
